# Support VLOCATION (RFC9073)

Lets add support for "Event Publishing Extensions to iCalendar"
At least the basics.
This is a replacement for VVENUE, which is from a discontinued draft that was never release <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-norris-ical-venue-01>

## Stages

### 1. Lets get familiar with <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9073>.

List out all the necessary new components, parameters, properties that need to be added.
Find out if there is syntax we don't yet support (e.g. multiple instances of the same parameter in one property).

Are there any dependencies on other RFCs that we have not implemented yet?
Should we implement those RFC first?

### 2. Prepare the testing environment.
Create a fixture that demonstrates the necessary properties and parameters that can serve as a test for the parser as well.
Take this straight from the RFC if possible

### 3. Implement the module
Implement the module with the necessary components, parameters, and properties.
Settle for a distinct subset first. Put the rest in a markdown todo-list in the module documentation.
Test the implementation with the fixture created in step 2.

### 4. Mark the VVENUE types as deprecated
mark types and methods that stem from `draft-norris-ical-venue-01` as `#[deprecated]`

## Implementation Progress

Current stage: 3 (we have a fixture)
